## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't learn much new stuff but I took the time to practice. One thing that I didn't quite understood and still don't is the position of the background. I tried to replicate it from the design but it still isn't the same in my opinion. 

- Something that I did learn is that i can't use justy-self on flex-box items.

There is no new code that I allready didn't know.

### Continued development

I want to use flexbox in the future and I want to learn more about background-positioning.
